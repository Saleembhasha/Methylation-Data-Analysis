# Integration of Gene Expression and Region-Specific DNA Methylation to Identify Anticorrelated Regulatory Relationship
Key steps explained:
Select methylation probes from specific regions (e.g., TSS1500).

Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson or Spearman) between the expression of each gene and the beta values of corresponding probes in the region, across all samples.

Identify significantly anticorrelated probes (e.g., those with a correlation coefficient < −0.3 and a significant p-value).

Aggregate or enumerate beta scores (methylation levels) of these probes, gene-wise, for each sample, yielding a summary metric that reflects the methylation status of that gene’s regulatory region across samples.

This approach is commonly used for integrative multi-omics analyses to link gene regulation (methylation) and gene activity (expression) in cancer, epigenetics, or developmental studies.​​
